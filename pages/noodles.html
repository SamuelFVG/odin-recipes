      <li>4 x 72g packets Maggi 2 Minute Noodles Chicken Flavour</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil and butter in a large, deep frying pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and bacon.
        Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes or until onion softens. Transfer 2 tablespoons
        onion mixture to a small bowl. Cover to keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add flour and 2 of the chicken flavour sachets from noodles to pan (discard remaining
        flavour sachets). Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium. Gradually stir in
        milk and 2 cups water. Bring to a simmer. Add noodles. Cook, stirring occasionally to break
        up noodles, for 2 minutes or until noodles are tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add peas and cheese. Cook for a further 1 to 2 minutes or until peas are bright green and
        tender. Add parsley and lemon zest to reserved onion mixture. Season with salt and pepper.
        Toss to combine.
      </li>
      <li>Remove noodles from heat. Sprinkle with onion mixture. Serve.</li>
